# Unexpected ZeroDivisionError in Python Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in a simple Python function. The function is intended to handle division by zero gracefully, but it fails due to the order of conditional checks. This leads to an unexpected `ZeroDivisionError` even when the function could have returned a valid result. 

The bug is explained in detail in the `bug.py` file. The solution, demonstrating how to correctly handle the case, is in `bugSolution.py`.
